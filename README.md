## How it works

This repository utilizes `vuepress-deploy` to automatically deploy the current `master` branch to github pages.

![repo-architecture](./docs/images/docs/architecture.png)

A Pullrequest-Review-Workflow is applied to get changes into the `master`. From there on an automatic github workflow script utilizing `vuepress-deploy` is taking over. The vuepress page is built and force-pushed to the `gh-pages` branch, which in turn is then deployed on the github pages infrastructure and bound to the web address [IT4C.dev](https://www.it4c.dev).
