# Ulf Gebhardt

![Ulf Gebhardt](~@images/portrait/ulf-gebhardt.jpg)

Ulf is a software developer through and through. He started to program when he was 12 and kept going with it. He is very knowledgeable about the possibilities soft- and hardware has to offer and is the person to turn to when it is time to include a new library correctly or implement an algorithm. He is known to use the "Holzhammer-Methode" (brute-force approach) when it is time to solve conflicts within the team.

In his free time he programs as every good programmer does and travels the world by foot when its time to leave the screen for a while.
