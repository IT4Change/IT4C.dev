## Presentation
![Hannes Heine](~@images/portrait/hannes-heine.jpg)

I was born in germany and raised in france, so I speak both languages fluently.

As child except for my interest for sports I always excelled in sciences. In 10th grade I came across coding, it was so exiting I had the impression that I could do magic on a small device. It captivated me so much that after the graduation in 2008 (baccalaur√©at) I studied for 3 years in the beautiful city of Toulouse, in the fields of mathematics, mechanics and informatics.

After that I moved back to germany in the city were I was born Hamburg. Their I worked for two different programming companies (White Paper Media ltd. and MSP AG) until 2017 were I made myself a freelancer.

As freelancer I worked on different projects: For the DeutscheSee were I supported them for the shop development, Human Connection were I helped to translate from german to french, Gradido were I do tasks from backend to frontend, and I setup small Shopware shops.

In my free time I like to play video games, do some reiki and all kind of sports. I travel between south france and a bit in germany.
