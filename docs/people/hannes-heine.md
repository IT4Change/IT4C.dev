## Presentation

![Hannes Heine](~@images/portrait/hannes-heine.jpg)

I was born in Germany and raised in France, so I speak both languages fluently. In my free time I like to play video games, do Reiki and all kind of sports.
As child except for my interest for sports I always excelled in sciences. In 10th grade I came across coding, the starting time was so exiting I had the impression that I could do magic on a small device. It captivated me so much that after my graduation in 2008 (baccalaurÃ©at), I studied for 3 years in the beautiful city of Toulouse (mathematics, mechanics and informatics).
After that I moved back to Germany in the city were I was born - Hamburg.
