# Ocelot.Social

After the closing of the Human-Connection network, the developer and the users wanted to continue to work on the idea. So we created an not branded project so that it can be deployed for different networks with their own brand.

Ocelot.Social has the following functions:

- User Accounts
- User Roles
- news feed (Posts)
  - Filter
- posts
  - as articles
  - as events
  - comments
- Search
- Groups
- Map

## Demo

Try out the application under the following link [Ocelot.Social](https://stage.ocelot.social/)
