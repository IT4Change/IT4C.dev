# History

This section gives an overview when which person became a member of our team and how IT4C became to be.

It all began ~2017, when [Alex](people/alexander-friedland.md), who made the initial website for the DEMOCRACY project, met with [Ulf](people/ulf-gebhardt.md) in Karlsruhe to <!-- textlint-disable write-good-->evaluate<!-- textlint-enable write-good --> the state of election methods available in universities at given time. Ulf started to work with DEMOCRACY and when the project had its public appearance [Wolle](people/wolfgang-huss.md) made contact to work with the project as an influencer. 

## Human Connection

Most of us met again 2019 at Human Connection. This time all as developers to <!-- textlint-disable write-good-->implement<!-- textlint-enable write-good --> the envisioned social network. [Wolle](people/wolfgang-huss.md) was first, followed by [Alex](people/alexander-friedland.md) and [Ulf](people/ulf-gebhardt.md). While Ulf left for DEMOCRACY again, Hannes volunteered and Moriz joined the Team, till the project ended 2020 as Human Connection and was transformed into *ocelot.social*.

## Ocelot.Social - end of Human Connection

In the last quarter of 2020 Human Connection was ended as a project and the source code was republished under the name Ocelot.social. [Wolle](people/wolfgang-huss.md), [Alex](people/alexander-friedland.md), [Ulf](people/ulf-gebhardt.md) and Moriz continued on the project and released wir.social to keep ocelot alive.

## Gradido

In 2021 most of the team joined the [Gradido](https://github.com/gradido/gradido) project. As always our scout [Alex](people/alexander-friedland.md) was first, followed by [Ulf](people/ulf-gebhardt.md), who was residing in Norway at the time. Soon after Moriz joined up and Hannes came on board in Summer 2021.
When Ulf went on a trip to Italy [Wolle](people/wolfgang-huss.md) could <!-- textlint-disable write-good-->finally<!-- textlint-enable write-good --> be convinced to join, soon followed by [Mathias](people/mathias-lenz.md).

## Yunite.me

During 2022 the Yunite-Team approached the team to get a new social network going based on ocelot-social. The new network was release on 01.11.2022 under the name yunite.me.

## IT4C

With the start of 2023 the IT4C brand name and [website](https://www.it4c.dev) was established to allow the team members to present themselves and the team as a whole.
